abstract = {The Human Connectome Project consortium led by Washington University, University of Minnesota, and Oxford University is undertaking a systematic effort to map macroscopic human brain circuits and their relationship to behavior in a large population of healthy adults. This overview article focuses on progress made during the first half of the 5-year project in refining the methods for data acquisition and analysis. Preliminary analyses based on a finalized set of acquisition and preprocessing protocols demonstrate the exceptionally high quality of the data from each modality. The first quarterly release of imaging and behavioral data via the ConnectomeDB database demonstrates the commitment to making HCP datasets freely accessible. Altogether, the progress to date provides grounds for optimism that the HCP datasets and associated methods and software will become increasingly valuable resources for characterizing human brain connectivity and function, their relationship to behavior, and their heritability and genetic underpinnings.},

abstract = {Anisotropic water diffusion in neural fibres such as nerve, white matter in spinal cord, or white matter in brain forms the basis for the utilization of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to track fibre pathways. The fact that water diffusion is sensitive to the underlying tissue microstructure provides a unique method of assessing the orientation and integrity of these neural fibres, which may be useful in assessing a number of neurological disorders. The purpose of this review is to characterize the relationship of nuclear magnetic resonance measurements of water diffusion and its anisotropy (i.e. directional dependence) with the underlying microstructure of neural fibres. The emphasis of the review will be on model neurological systems both in vitro and in vivo. A systematic discussion of the possible sources of anisotropy and their evaluation will be presented followed by an overview of various studies of restricted diffusion and compartmentation as they relate to anisotropy. Pertinent pathological models, developmental studies and theoretical analyses provide further insight into the basis of anisotropic diffusion and its potential utility in the nervous system.},

abstract = {Fiber tract trajectories in coherently organized brain white matter pathways were computed from in vivo diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) data. First, a continuous diffusion tensor field is constructed from this discrete, noisy, measured DT-MRI data. Then a Frenet equation, describing the evolution of a fiber tract, was solved. This approach was validated using synthesized, noisy DT-MRI data. Corpus callosum and pyramidal tract trajectories were constructed and found to be consistent with known anatomy. The method's reliability, however, degrades where the distribution of fiber tract directions is nonuniform. Moreover, background noise in diffusion-weighted MRIs can cause a computed trajectory to hop from tract to tract. Still, this method can provide quantitative information with which to visualize and study connectivity and continuity of neural pathways in the central and peripheral nervous systems in vivo, and holds promise for elucidating architectural features in other fibrous tissues and ordered media.},

Because reading relies on neural systems spread across the brain, a full understanding of this cognitive ability involves the identification of pathways that communicate information between these processing regions. In the past few years, diffusion tensor imaging has been used to identify correlations between white matter properties and reading skills in adults and children. White matter differences have been found in left temporo-parietal areas and in posterior callosal tracts. We review these findings and relate them to possible pathways that are important for various aspects of reading. We describe how the results from diffusion tensor imaging can be integrated with functional results in good and poor readers.},

Rapid advances in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have led to substantial insights into human brain development and disease processes and have thrust white matter into the focus of researchers and clinicians alike. The full clinical potential of this relatively new technique remains to be determined, but early indicators suggest that DTI will be a significant new technology in mapping mechanisms of human health and disease. Here we review brain changes that have been studied with DTI over the human lifespan and findings in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. We also suggest future areas where DTI is likely to have significant impact.},

@article{Jones2012,
abstract = {Diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) has been increasingly used in imaging neuroscience over the last decade. An early form of this technique, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was rapidly implemented by major MRI scanner companies as a scanner selling point. Due to the ease of use of such implementations, and the plausibility of some of their results, DTI was leapt on by imaging neuroscientists who saw it as a powerful and unique new tool for exploring the structural connectivity of human brain. However, DTI is a rather approximate technique, and its results have frequently been given implausible interpretations that have escaped proper critique and have appeared misleadingly in journals of high reputation. In order to encourage the use of improved DW-MRI methods, which have a better chance of characterizing the actual fiber structure of white matter, and to warn against the misuse and misinterpretation of DTI, we review the physics of DW-MRI, indicate currently preferred methodology, and explain the limits of interpretation of its results. We conclude with a list of øDo's and Don'tsù which define good practice in this expanding area of imaging neuroscience.},

abstract = {Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) enables non-invasive investigation and characterization of the white matter but suffers from a relatively poor spatial resolution. Increasing the spatial resolution in DWI is challenging with a single-shot EPI acquisition due to the decreased signal-to-noise ratio and T2(·) relaxation effect amplified with increased echo time. In this work we propose a super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) technique based on the acquisition of multiple anisotropic orthogonal DWI scans. DWI scans acquired in different planes are not typically closely aligned due to the geometric distortion introduced by magnetic susceptibility differences in each phase-encoding direction. We compensate each scan for geometric distortion by acquisition of a dual echo gradient echo field map, providing an estimate of the field inhomogeneity. We address the problem of patient motion by aligning the volumes in both space and q-space. The SRR is formulated as a maximum a posteriori problem. It relies on a volume acquisition model which describes how the acquired scans are observations of an unknown high-resolution image which we aim to recover. Our model enables the introduction of image priors that exploit spatial homogeneity and enables regularized solutions. We detail our SRR optimization procedure and report experiments including numerical simulations, synthetic SRR and real world SRR. In particular, we demonstrate that combining distortion compensation and SRR provides better results than acquisition of a single isotropic scan for the same acquisition duration time. Importantly, SRR enables DWI with resolution beyond the scanner hardware limitations. This work provides the first evidence that SRR, which employs conventional single shot EPI techniques, enables resolution enhancement in DWI, and may dramatically impact the role of DWI in both neuroscience and clinical applications.},

@article{Hall2009,
abstract = {This paper describes a general and flexible Monte- Carlo simulation framework for diffusing spins that generates realistic synthetic data for diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. Similar systems in the literature consider only simple substrates and their authors do not consider convergence and parameter optimization. We show how to run Monte-Carlo simulations within complex irregular substrates. We compare the results of the Monte-Carlo simulation to an analytical model of restricted diffusion to assess precision and accuracy of the generated results. We obtain an optimal combination of spins and updates for a given run time by trading off number of updates in favor of number of spins such that precision and accuracy of sythesized data are both optimized. Further experiments demonstrate the system using a tissue environment that current analytic models cannot capture. This tissue model incorporates swelling, abutting, and deformation. Swelling-induced restriction in the extracellular space due to the effects of abutting cylinders leads to large departures from the predictions of the analytical model, which does not capture these effects. This swelling-induced restriction may be an important mechanism in explaining the changes in apparent diffusion constant observed in the aftermath of acute ischemic stroke.},

@article{Budde2012,
abstract = {The mammalian central nervous system has a tremendous structural complexity, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is unique in its ability to extract microstructural tissue properties at a macroscopic scale. However, despite its widespread use and applications in clinical and research settings, accurate validation of DTI has notoriously lagged the advances in image acquisition and analysis. In this report, we demonstrate an approach to visualize and quantify the microscopic features of histological sections on multiple length scales using techniques derived from image texture analysis. Structure tensor (ST) analysis was applied to fluorescence microscopy images of rat brain sections to visualize and quantify tissue microstructure. Images were digitally color-coded based on the local orientation in the pixelwise ST implementation, which allowed direct visualization of white matter complexity at the microscopic level. A piecewise ST algorithm was also employed to quantify anisotropy and orientation at a resolution comparable to that typically acquired with DTI. Anisotropy measured with ST analysis of stained histological sections was highly correlated with anisotropy measured by ex vivo DTI of the same brains (R(2)=0.92). Furthermore, angular histograms, or Fiber Orientation Distributions (FODs), were computed to mimic similar measures derived from high angular resolution diffusion imaging methods. The FODs for each pixel were fit to a mixture of von Mises distributions to identify putative regions of multiple fiber populations (i.e. crossing fibers). Despite its current application to two-dimensional microscopy, the ST analysis is a novel approach to visualize and quantify microstructure in the central nervous system in both health and disease, and advances the available set of tools for validating DTI and other diffusion MRI techniques.},

@article{Lazar2003,
abstract = {White matter tractography using diffusion tensor MR images is a promising method for estimating the pathways of white matter tracts in the human brain. The success of this method ultimately depends upon the accuracy of the white matter tractography algorithms. In this study, a Monte Carlo simulation was used to investigate the impact of SNR, tensor anisotropy, and diffusion tensor encoding directions on the accuracy of six tractography algorithms. The accuracy was assessed in straight and curved tracts and tract geometries with divergence properties. In general, the tract dispersion increased with distance and decreased with SNR and anisotropy. The tract orientation with respect to the encoding scheme also influenced tract dispersion. Divergent tract geometries increased tract dispersion, whereas convergent tract geometries reduced dispersion. Analytic models of tract dispersion were constructed as a function of the tract distance, SNR, eigenvalues of the tracts, voxel size, and the relationship between the tract direction and the diffusion tensor encoding directions. In certain cases, the mean tract trajectory was found to deviate from the ideal pathway for curved trajectories. Analytical models of mean displacement were constructed as a function of the curvature, tract distance, step size, and tensor eigenvalues. These models may be used in future studies to assess the level of confidence associated with a tractography result.},

A new realization of this principle is presented. The method utilizes data acquired with high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI), a measurement method that fulfills clinical requirements. For the first time among global reconstruction methods, the computation time is acceptable for a broad class of practical applications. The method does not involve any boundary conditions that prescribe the location of the ends of reconstructed fibers. This helps to minimize necessary user interaction and operator dependence. Results obtained in a physical phantom demonstrate a high reconstruction quality. In vivo results have been obtained in several volunteers. The algorithm found a number of prominent fascicles including those in the limbic system, which had been problematic for a previously published version of global tracking.},

@article{Jing2012,
abstract = {In diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), reliable fiber tracking results rely on the accurate reconstruction of the fiber orientation distribution function (fODF) in each individual voxel. For high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI), deconvolution-based approaches can reconstruct the complex fODF and have advantages in terms of computational efficiency and no need to estimate the number of distinct fiber populations. However, HARDI-based methods usually require relatively high b-values and a large number of gradient directions to produce good results. Such requirements are not always easy to meet in common clinical studies due to limitations in MRI facilities. Moreover, most of these approaches are sensitive to noise. In this study, we propose a new framework to enhance the performance of the spherical deconvolution (SD) approach in low angular resolution DWI by employing a single channel blind source separation (BSS) technique to decompose the fODF initially estimated by SD such that the desired fODF can be extracted from the noisy background. The results based on numerical simulations and two phantom datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance than SD in terms of robustness to noise and variation in b-values. In addition, the results show that the proposed method has the potential to be applied to low angular resolution DWI which is commonly used in clinical studies.},

@article{Bloy2012,
abstract = {Structural connectivity models hold great promise for expanding what is known about the ways information travels throughout the brain. The physiologic interpretability of structural connectivity models depends heavily on how the connections between regions are quantified. This article presents an integrated structural connectivity framework designed around such an interpretation. The framework provides three measures to characterize the structural connectivity of a subject: (1) the structural connectivity matrix describing the proportion of connections between pairs of nodes, (2) the nodal connection distribution (nCD) characterizing the proportion of connections that terminate in each node, and (3) the connection density image, which presents the density of connections as they traverse through white matter (WM). Individually, each possesses different information concerning the structural connectivity of the individual and could potentially be useful for a variety of tasks, ranging from characterizing and localizing group differences to identifying novel parcellations of the cortex. The efficiency of the proposed framework allows the determination of large structural connectivity networks, consisting of many small nodal regions, providing a more detailed description of a subject's connectivity. The nCD provides a gray matter contrast that can potentially aid in investigating local cytoarchitecture and connectivity. Similarly, the connection density images offer insight into the WM pathways, potentially identifying focal differences that affect a number of pathways. The reliability of these measures was established through a test/retest paradigm performed on nine subjects, while the utility of the method was evaluated through its applications to 20 diffusion datasets acquired from typically developing adolescents.},

abstract = {This article proposes a new measure called Apparent Fibre Density (AFD) for the analysis of high angular resolution diffusion-weighted images using higher-order information provided by fibre orientation distributions (FODs) computed using spherical deconvolution. AFD has the potential to provide specific information regarding differences between populations by identifying not only the location, but also the orientations along which differences exist. In this work, analytical and numerical Monte-Carlo simulations are used to support the use of the FOD amplitude as a quantitative measure (i.e. AFD) for population and longitudinal analysis. To perform robust voxel-based analysis of AFD, we present and evaluate a novel method to modulate the FOD to account for changes in fibre bundle cross-sectional area that occur during spatial normalisation. We then describe a novel approach for statistical analysis of AFD that uses cluster-based inference of differences extended throughout space and orientation. Finally, we demonstrate the capability of the proposed method by performing voxel-based AFD comparisons between a group of Motor Neurone Disease patients and healthy control subjects. A significant decrease in AFD was detected along voxels and orientations corresponding to both the corticospinal tract and corpus callosal fibres that connect the primary motor cortices. In addition to corroborating previous findings in MND, this study demonstrates the clear advantage of using this type of analysis by identifying differences along single fibre bundles in regions containing multiple fibre populations.},

Use of an accurate streamlines propagation mask from segmentation of an anatomical image confines the streamlines to the volume of the brain white matter, but does not take full advantage of all of the information available from such an image. We present a modular addition to streamlines tractography, which makes more effective use of the information available from anatomical image segmentation, and the known properties of the neuronal axons being reconstructed, to apply biologically realistic priors to the streamlines generated; we refer to this as "Anatomically-Constrained Tractography". Results indicate that some of the known false positives associated with tractography algorithms are prevented, such that the biological accuracy of the reconstructions should be improved, provided that state-of-the-art streamlines tractography methods are used.},

abstract = {Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging has led to active research in the analysis of anatomical connectivity in the brain. Many approaches have been proposed to model the diffusion signal and to obtain estimates of fibre tracts. Despite these advances, the question of defining probabilistic connectivity indices which utilize the relevant information in the diffusion MRI signal to indicate connectivity strength, remains largely open. To address this problem we introduce a novel numerical implementation of a stochastic completion field algorithm, which models the diffusion of water molecules in a medium while incorporating the local diffusion MRI data. We show that the approach yields a valid probabilistic estimate of connectivity strength between two seed regions, with experimental results on the MICCAI 2009 Fibre Cup phantom.},

  abstract       = {Based on the Fourier transform relation between
                   diffusion MR signals and the underlying diffusion
                   displacement, a new relation is derived to estimate the
                   spin distribution function (SDF) directly from
                   diffusion MR signals. This relation leads to an imaging
                   method called generalized q-sampling imaging (GQI),
                   which can obtain the SDF from the shell sampling scheme
                   used in q-ball imaging (QBI) or the grid sampling
                   scheme used in diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI). The
                   accuracy of GQI was evaluated by a simulation study and
                   an in vivo experiment in comparison with QBI and DSI.
                   The simulation results showed that the accuracy of GQI
                   was comparable to that of QBI and DSI. The simulation
                   study of GQI also showed that an anisotropy index,
                   named quantitative anisotropy, was correlated with the
                   volume fraction of the resolved fiber component. The in
                   vivo images of GQI demonstrated that SDF patterns were
                   similar to the ODFs reconstructed by QBI or DSI. The
                   tractography generated from GQI was also similar to
                   those generated from QBI and DSI. In conclusion, the
                   proposed GQI method can be applied to grid or shell
                   sampling schemes and can provide directional and
                   quantitative information about the crossing fibers.},

abstract = {This paper considers the model problem of reconstructing an object from incomplete frequency samples. Consider a discrete-time signal fCN and a randomly chosen set of frequencies . Is it possible to reconstruct f from the partial knowledge of its Fourier coefficients on the set ? A typical result of this paper is as follows. Suppose that f is a superposition of T spikes f(t)= Tf( ) (t- ) obeying TCM(log N)-1 for some constant CM>0. We do not know the locations of the spikes nor their amplitudes. Then with probability at least 1-O(N-M), f can be reconstructed exactly as the solution to the 1 minimization problem. In short, exact recovery may be obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. We give numerical values for CM which depend on the desired probability of success. Our result may be interpreted as a novel kind of nonlinear sampling theorem. In effect, it says that any signal made out of T spikes may be recovered by convex programming from almost every set of frequencies of size O(TlogN). Moreover, this is nearly optimal in the sense that any method succeeding with probability 1-O(N-M) would in general require a number of frequency samples at least proportional to TlogN. The methodology extends to a variety of other situations and higher dimensions. For example, we show how one can reconstruct a piecewise constant (one- or two-dimensional) object from incomplete frequency samples - provided that the number of jumps (discontinuities) obeys the condition above - by minimizing other convex functionals such as the total variation of f.},

abstract = {Visualization and analysis of the micro-architecture of brain parenchyma by means of magnetic resonance imaging is nowadays believed to be one of the most powerful tools used for the assessment of various cerebral conditions as well as for understanding the intracerebral connectivity. Unfortunately, the conventional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) used for estimating the local orientations of neural fibers is incapable of performing reliably in the situations when a voxel of interest accommodates multiple fiber tracts. In this case, a much more accurate analysis is possible using the high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) that represents local diffusion by its apparent coefficients measured as a discrete function of spatial orientations. In this note, a novel approach to enhancing and modeling the HARDI signals using multiresolution bases of spherical ridgelets is presented. In addition to its desirable properties of being adaptive, sparsifying, and efficiently computable, the proposed modeling leads to analytical computation of the orientation distribution functions associated with the measured diffusion, thereby providing a fast and robust analytical solution for q-ball imaging.},

This article adapts FOCUSS for a projection reconstruction MR imaging problem to obtain high resolution reconstructions from angular under-sampled radial k-space data. We show that FOCUSS is effective for projection reconstruction MRI, since medical images are usually sparse in some sense and the center region of the undersampled radial k-space samples still provides a low resolution, yet meaningful, image essential for the convergence of FOCUSS. The new algorithm is successfully applied for synthetic data as well as in vivo brain imaging obtained by under-sampled radial spin echo sequence.},

  abstract = {Most image segmentation algorithms in the past are based on optimizing
	an objective function that aims to achieve the similarity between
	several low-level features to build a partition of the image into
	homogeneous regions. In the present paper, we propose to incorporate
	the relevance (selection) of the grouping features to enforce the
	segmentation toward the capturing of objects of interest. The relevance
	of the features is determined through a set of positive and negative
	examples of a specific object defined a priori by the user. The calculation
	of the relevance of the features is performed by maximizing an objective
	function defined on the mixture likelihoods of the positive and negative
	object examples sets. The incorporation of the features relevance
	in the object segmentation is formulated through an energy functional
	which is minimized by using level set active contours. We show the
	efficiency of the approach on several examples of object of interest
	segmentation and tracking where the features relevance is used.},

  abstract = {The dissociation between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and permanent
	disability in multiple sclerosis (MS), termed the clinicoradiological
	paradox, can primarily be attributed to the lack of specificity of
	conventional, relaxivity-based MRI measurements in detecting axonal
	damage, the primary pathological correlate of long-term impairment
	in MS. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has shown promise in specifically
	detecting axonal damage and demyelination in MS and its animal model,
	experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). To quantify the
	specificity of DTI in detecting axonal injury, in vivo DTI maps from
	the spinal cords of mice with EAE and quantitative histological maps
	were both registered to a common space. A pixelwise correlation analysis
	between DTI parameters, histological metrics, and EAE scores revealed
	a significant correlation between the water diffusion parallel to
	the white matter fibers, or axial diffusivity, and EAE score. Furthermore,
	axial diffusivity was the primary correlate of quantitative staining
	for neurofilaments (SMI31), markers of axonal integrity. Both axial
	diffusivity and neurofilament staining were decreased throughout
	the entire white matter, not solely within the demyelinated lesions
	seen in EAE. In contrast, although anisotropy was significantly correlated
	with EAE score, it was not correlated with axonal damage. The results
	demonstrate a strong, quantitative relationship between axial diffusivity
	and axonal damage and show that anisotropy is not specific for axonal
	damage after inflammatory demyelination.},

	criterion for registration of intra-individual images from different
	modalities. Multi-resolution coarse-to-fine optimization was proposed
	for speeding-up of the registration process. The aim of our work
	was to further improve registration speed without compromising robustness
	or accuracy. We present and evaluate two procedures for co-registration
	of positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance (MR)
	images of human brain that combine a multi-resolution approach with
	an automatic segmentation of input image volumes into areas of interest
	and background. We show that an acceleration factor of 10 can be
	achieved for clinical data and that a suitable preprocessing can
	improve robustness of registration. Emphasis was laid on creation
	of an automatic registration system that could be used routinely
	in a clinical environment. For this purpose, an easy-to-use graphical
	user interface has been developed. It allows physicians with no special
	knowledge of the registration algorithm to perform a fast and reliable
	alignment of images. Registration progress is presented on the fly
	on a fusion of images and enables visual checking during a registration.},

	and Validation},
  school = {School of Computer Science, McGill University, MontrÃ©al},
  year = {2004},
  month = {June},
  abstract = {Often in neurosurgical planning a dual echo acquisition is performed
	that yields

	proton density (PD) and T2-weighted images to evaluate edema near
	a tumor or

	lesion. The development of vessel segmentation algorithms for PD images
	is of

	general interest since this type of acquisition is widespread and
	is entirely noninvasive.

	Whereas vessels are signaled by black blood contrast in such images,

	extracting them is a challenge because other anatomical structures
	also yield similar

	contrasts at their boundaries.

	In this thesis we present a novel multi-scale geometric flow for segmenting
	vasculature

	from PD images which can also be applied to the easier cases of MR

	angiography data or Gadolinium enhanced MRI. The key idea is to first
	apply

	Frangiâs vesselness measure [Frangi et al. (1998)] to find putative
	centerlines of

	tubular structures along with their estimated radii. This multi-scale
	measure is

	then distributed to create a vector field which is orthogonal to vessel
	boundaries

	so that the flux maximizing flow algorithm of Vasilevskiy and Siddiqi
	(2002) can

	be applied to recover them. We carry out a qualitative validation
	of the approach

	on PD, MR angiography and Gadolinium enhanced MRI volumes and suggest
	a

	new way to visualize the segmentations in 2D with masked projections.
	We also

	validate the approach quantitatively on a data set consisting of PD,
	phase contrast

	(PC) angiography and time of flight (TOF) angiography volumes, all
	obtained for

	the same subject. A significant finding is that over 80% of the vasculature
	recovered

	in the angiographic data sets is also recovered from the PD volume.
	Furthermore,

	over 25% of the vasculature recovered from the PD volume is not detectable
	in the

	TOF angiographic data.

	Thus, the technique can be used not only to improve upon results obtained
	from

	angiographic data but also as an alternative when such data is not
	available.},

@article{Ennis2006,
abstract = {This paper outlines the mathematical development and application of two analytically orthogonal tensor invariants sets. Diffusion tensors can be mathematically decomposed into shape and orientation information, determined by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, respectively. The developments herein orthogonally decompose the tensor shape using a set of three orthogonal invariants that characterize the magnitude of isotropy, the magnitude of anisotropy, and the mode of anisotropy. The mode of anisotropy is useful for resolving whether a region of anisotropy is linear anisotropic, orthotropic, or planar anisotropic. Both tensor trace and fractional anisotropy are members of an orthogonal invariant set, but they do not belong to the same set. It is proven that tensor trace and fractional anisotropy are not mutually orthogonal measures of the diffusive process. The results are applied to the analysis and visualization of diffusion tensor magnetic resonance images of the brain in a healthy volunteer. The theoretical developments provide a method for generating scalar maps of the diffusion tensor data, including novel fractional anisotropy maps that are color encoded for the mode of anisotropy and directionally encoded colormaps of only linearly anisotropic structures, rather than of high fractional anisotropy structures.},

	we plan to measure n general linear functionals of x and then reconstruct.
	If x is known to be compressible by transform coding with a known
	transform, and we reconstruct via the nonlinear procedure defined
	here, the number of measurements n can be dramatically smaller than
	the size m. Thus, certain natural classes of images with m pixels
	need only n=O(m1/4log5/2(m)) nonadaptive nonpixel samples for faithful
	recovery, as opposed to the usual m pixel samples. More specifically,
	suppose x has a sparse representation in some orthonormal basis (e.g.,
	wavelet, Fourier) or tight frame (e.g., curvelet, Gabor)-so the coefficients
	belong to an lscrp ball for 0<ples1. The N most important coefficients
	in that expansion allow reconstruction with lscr2 error O(N1/2-1p/).
	It is possible to design n=O(Nlog(m)) nonadaptive measurements allowing
	reconstruction with accuracy comparable to that attainable with direct
	knowledge of the N most important coefficients. Moreover, a good
	approximation to those N important coefficients is extracted from
	the n measurements by solving a linear program-Basis Pursuit in signal
	processing. The nonadaptive measurements have the character of "random"
	linear combinations of basis/frame elements. Our results use the
	notions of optimal recovery, of n-widths, and information-based complexity.
	We estimate the Gel'fand n-widths of lscrp balls in high-dimensional
	Euclidean space in the case 0<ples1, and give a criterion identifying
	near- optimal subspaces for Gel'fand n-widths. We show that "most"
	subspaces are near-optimal, and show that convex optimization (Basis
	Pursuit) is a near-optimal way to extract information derived from
	these near-optimal subspaces},

	of the nth root computation of a strictly positive real number are

	of convergence p natural, p >= 2. We consider affine combinations
	of the two modified pth-order methods which lead to a family of methods
	of order p with arbitrarily small asymptotic constants. Moreover
	the methods are of order p+1 for some specific values of a parameter.
	Then we consider affine combinations of the three methods of order
	p+1 to get methods of order p+1 again with arbitrarily small asymptotic
	constants. The methods can be of order p+2 with arbitrarily small
	asymptotic constants, and also of order p+3 for some specific values
	of the parameters of the affine combination. It is shown that infinitely
	many pth-order methods exist for the nth root computation of a strictly
	positive real number for any p >= 3.},

  abstract = {Novel methodologies have been recently developed to characterize the
	microgeometry of neural tissues and porous structures via diffusion
	MRI data. In line with these previous works, this article provides
	a detailed mathematical description of q-space in spherical coordinates
	that helps to highlight the differences and similarities between
	various related q-space methodologies proposed to date such as q-ball
	imaging (QBI), diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI), and diffusion orientation
	transform imaging (DOT). This formulation provides a direct relationship
	between the orientation distribution function (ODF) and the diffusion
	data without using any approximation. Under this relationship, the
	exact ODF can be computed by means of the Radon transform of the
	radial projection (in q-space) of the diffusion MRI signal. This
	new methodology, termed exact q-ball imaging (EQBI), was put into
	practice using an analytical ODF estimation in terms of spherical
	harmonics that allows obtaining model-free and model-based reconstructions.
	This work provides a new framework for combining information coming
	from diffusion data recorded on multiple spherical shells in q-space
	(hybrid diffusion imaging encoding scheme), which is capable of mapping
	ODF to a high accuracy. This represents a step toward a more efficient
	development of diffusion MRI experiments for obtaining better ODF
	estimates. Magn Reson Med, 2009. Â© 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

@article{honey-sporns-etal:09,
abstract = {In the cerebral cortex, the activity levels of neuronal populations are continuously fluctuating. When neuronal activity, as measured using functional MRI (fMRI), is temporally coherent across 2 populations, those populations are said to be functionally connected. Functional connectivity has previously been shown to correlate with structural (anatomical) connectivity patterns at an aggregate level. In the present study we investigate, with the aid of computational modeling, whether systems-level properties of functional networks--including their spatial statistics and their persistence across time--can be accounted for by properties of the underlying anatomical network. We measured resting state functional connectivity (using fMRI) and structural connectivity (using diffusion spectrum imaging tractography) in the same individuals at high resolution. Structural connectivity then provided the couplings for a model of macroscopic cortical dynamics. In both model and data, we observed (i) that strong functional connections commonly exist between regions with no direct structural connection, rendering the inference of structural connectivity from functional connectivity impractical; (ii) that indirect connections and interregional distance accounted for some of the variance in functional connectivity that was unexplained by direct structural connectivity; and (iii) that resting-state functional connectivity exhibits variability within and across both scanning sessions and model runs. These empirical and modeling results demonstrate that although resting state functional connectivity is variable and is frequently present between regions without direct structural linkage, its strength, persistence, and spatial statistics are nevertheless constrained by the large-scale anatomical structure of the human cerebral cortex.},

	need for sophisticated alignment techniques, allowing clinicians

  abstract = {For non-Cartesian data acquisition in MRI, k-space trajectory infidelity
	due to eddy current effects and other hardware imperfections will
	blur and distort the reconstructed images. Even with the shielded
	gradients and eddy current compensation techniques of current scanners,
	the deviation between the actual k-space trajectory and the requested
	trajectory remains a major reason for image artifacts in non-Cartesian
	MRI. It is often not practical to measure the k-space trajectory
	for each imaging slice. It has been reported that better image quality
	is achieved in radial scanning by correcting anisotropic delays on
	different physical gradient axes. In this article the delay model
	is applied in spiral k-space trajectory estimation to reduce image
	artifacts. Then a novel estimation method combining the anisotropic
	delay model and a simple convolution eddy current model further reduces
	the artifact level in spiral image reconstruction. The root mean
	square error and peak error in both phantom and in vivo images reconstructed
	using the estimated trajectories are reduced substantially compared
	to the results achieved by only tuning delays. After a one-time calibration,
	it is thus possible to get an accurate estimate of the spiral trajectory
	and a high-quality image reconstruction for an arbitrary scan plane.

	magnetization transfer (MT) imaging protocol that overcomes limitations
	in T1w images, which are mainly due to their sensitivity to the high
	iron content in subcortical grey matter. We demonstrate improved
	automated segmentation of putamen, pallidum, pulvinar and substantia
	nigra using MT images. A comparison with segmentation of high-quality
	T1w images was performed in 49 healthy subjects. Our results show
	that MT maps are highly suitable for automated segmentation, and
	so for multi-subject morphometric studies with a focus on subcortical
	structures.},

  abstract = {Linear registration and motion correction are important components
	of structural and functional brain image analysis. Most modern methods
	optimize some intensity-based cost function to determine the best
	registration. To date, little attention has been focused on the optimization
	method itself, even though the success of most registration methods
	hinges on the quality of this optimization. This paper examines the
	optimization process in detail and demonstrates that the commonly
	used multiresolution local optimization methods can, and do, get
	trapped in local minima. To address this problem, two approaches
	are taken: (1) to apodize the cost function and (2) to employ a novel
	hybrid global-local optimization method. This new optimization method
	is specifically designed for registering whole brain images. It substantially
	reduces the likelihood of producing misregistrations due to being
	trapped by local minima. The increased robustness of the method,
	compared to other commonly used methods, is demonstrated by a consistency
	test. In addition, the accuracy of the registration is demonstrated
	by a series of experiments with motion correction. These motion correction
	experiments also investigate how the results are affected by different
	cost functions and interpolation methods.},

  abstract = {Conventional approaches to image registration are generally limited
	to image-wide rigid transformations. However, the body and its internal
	organs are non-rigid structures that change shape due to changes
	in the body's posture during image acquisition, and due to normal,
	pathological and treatment-related variations. Inter-subject matching
	also constitutes a non-rigid registration problem. In this paper,
	we present a fully automated non-rigid image registration method
	that maximizes a local voxel-based similarity metric. Overlapping
	image blocks are defined on a 3D grid. The transformation vector
	field representing image deformation is found by translating each
	block so as to maximize the local similarity measure. The resulting
	sparsely sampled vector field is median filtered and interpolated
	by a Gaussian function to ensure a locally smooth transformation.
	A hierarchical strategy is adopted to progressively establish local
	registration associated with image structures at diminishing scale.
	Simulation studies were carried out to evaluate the proposed algorithm
	and to determine the robustness of various voxel-based cost functions.
	Mutual information, normalized mutual information, correlation ratio
	(CR) and a new symmetric version of CR were evaluated and compared.
	A T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) image was used to test intra-modality
	registration. Proton density and T2-weighted MR images of the same
	subject were used to evaluate inter-modality registration. The proposed
	algorithm was tested on the 2D MR images distorted by known deformations
	and 3D images simulating inter-subject distortions. We studied the
	robustness of cost functions with respect to image sampling. Results
	indicate that the symmetric CR gives comparable registration to mutual
	information in intra- and inter-modality tasks at full sampling and
	is superior to mutual information in registering sparsely sampled
	images.},

  abstract = {Traditional mutual information (MI) function aligns two multimodality
	images with intensity information, lacking spatial information, so
	that it usually presents many local maxima that can lead to inaccurate
	registration. Our paper proposes an algorithm of adaptive combination
	of intensity and gradient field mutual information (ACMI). Gradient
	code maps (GCM) are constructed by coding gradient field information
	of corresponding original images. The gradient field MI, calculated
	from GCMs, can provide complementary properties to intensity MI.
	ACMI combines intensity MI and gradient field MI with a nonlinear
	weight function, which can automatically adjust the proportion between
	two types MI in combination to improve registration. Experimental
	results demonstrate that ACMI outperforms the traditional MI and
	it is much less sensitive to reduced resolution or overlap of images.},

  abstract = {Recently, the spin-echo full-intensity acquired localized (SPECIAL)
	spectroscopy technique was proposed to unite the advantages of short
	TEs on the order of milliseconds (ms) with full sensitivity and applied
	to in vivo rat brain. In the present study, SPECIAL was adapted and
	optimized for use on a clinical platform at 3T and 7T by combining
	interleaved water suppression (WS) and outer volume saturation (OVS),
	optimized sequence timing, and improved shimming using FASTMAP. High-quality
	single voxel spectra of human brain were acquired at TEs below or
	equal to 6 ms on a clinical 3T and 7T system for six volunteers.
	Narrow linewidths (6.6 Â± 0.6 Hz at 3T and 12.1 Â± 1.0 Hz at 7T for
	water) and the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the artifact-free
	spectra enabled the quantification of a neurochemical profile consisting
	of 18 metabolites with CramÃ©r-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) below 20%
	at both field strengths. The enhanced sensitivity and increased spectral
	resolution at 7T compared to 3T allowed a two-fold reduction in scan
	time, an increased precision of quantification for 12 metabolites,
	and the additional quantification of lactate with CRLB below 20%.
	Improved sensitivity at 7T was also demonstrated by a 1.7-fold increase

  abstract = {We have recently proposed a two-dimensional Wavelet Encoding-Spectroscopic
	Imaging (WE-SI) technique as an alternative to Chemical Shift Imaging
	(CSI), to reduce acquisition time and crossvoxel contamination in
	magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). In this article
	we describe the extension of the WE-SI technique to three dimensions
	and its implementation on a clinical 1.5 T General Electric (GE)
	scanner. Phantom and in vivo studies are carried out to demonstrate
	the usefulness of this technique for further acquisition time reduction
	with low voxel contamination. In wavelet encoding, a set of dilated
	and translated prototype functions called wavelets are used to span
	a localized space by dividing it into a set of subspaces with predetermined
	sizes and locations. In spectroscopic imaging, this process is achieved
	using radiofrequency (RF) pulses with profiles resembling the wavelet
	shapes. Slice selective excitation and refocusing RF pulses, with
	single-band and dual-band profiles similar to Haar wavelets, are
	used in a modified PRESS sequence to acquire 3D WE-SI data. Wavelet
	dilation and translation are achieved by changing the strength of
	the localization gradients and frequency shift of the RF pulses,
	respectively. The desired spatial resolution in each direction sets
	the corresponding number of dilations (increases in the localization
	gradients), and consequently, the number of translations (frequency
	shift) of the Haar wavelets (RF pulses), which are used to collect
	magnetic resonance (MR) signals from the corresponding subspaces.
	Data acquisition time is reduced by using the minimum recovery time
	(TRmin), also called effective time, when successive MR signals from
	adjacent subspaces are collected. Inverse wavelet transform is performed
	on the acquired data to produce metabolite maps. The proposed WE-SI
	method is compared in terms of acquisition time, pixel bleed, and
	signal-to-noise ratio to the CSI technique. The study outcome shows
	that 3D WE-SI provides accurate results while reducing both acquisition
	time and voxel contamination. Magn Reson Med 61:6-15, 2009. Â© 2008

  abstract = {Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is
	an important tool for detecting subtle kinetic changes in cancerous
	tissue. Quantitative analysis of DCE-MRI typically involves the convolution
	of an arterial input function (AIF) with a nonlinear pharmacokinetic
	model of the contrast agent concentration. Parameters of the kinetic
	model are biologically meaningful, but the optimization of the nonlinear
	model has significant computational issues. In practice, convergence
	of the optimization algorithm is not guaranteed and the accuracy
	of the model fitting may be compromised. To overcome these problems,
	this paper proposes a semi-parametric penalized spline smoothing
	approach, where the AIF is convolved with a set of B-splines to produce
	a design matrix using locally adaptive smoothing parameters based
	on Bayesian penalized spline models (P-splines). It has been shown
	that kinetic parameter estimation can be obtained from the resulting
	deconvolved response function, which also includes the onset of contrast
	enhancement. Detailed validation of the method, both with simulated
	and in vivo data, is provided.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Diffusion tractography and functional/effective connectivity MRI provide a better understanding of the structural and functional human brain connectivity. This review will underline the major recent methodological developments and their exceptional respective contributions to physiological and pathophysiological studies in vivo. We will also emphasize the benefits provided by computational models of complex networks such as graph theory. RECENT FINDINGS: Imaging structural and functional brain connectivity has revealed the complex brain organization into large-scale networks. Such an organization not only permits the complex information segregation and integration during high cognitive processes but also determines the clinical consequences of alterations encountered in development, ageing, or neurological diseases. Recently, it has also been demonstrated that human brain networks shared topological properties with the so-called 'small-world' mathematical model, allowing a maximal efficiency with a minimal energy and wiring cost. SUMMARY: Separately, magnetic resonance tractography and functional MRI connectivity have both brought new insights into brain organization and the impact of injuries. The small-world topology of structural and functional human brain networks offers a common framework to merge structural and functional imaging as well as dynamical data from electrophysiology that might allow a comprehensive definition of the brain organization and plasticity.},

	and MRI sections with the same stereotaxic orientation. The purpose

	facilitating their identification; to make comparative studies of
	cortico-subcortical lesions possible on a basis of an equivalent
	reference system; to exploit the anatomo-functional data such as
	those furnished by SEEG in epilepsy and to enable the localization
	of special regions such as the SMA in three-dimensional space; and
	to apply the anatomical correlations of this reference system to
	neurophysiological investigations lacking sufficient anatomical back-up

	by a Fourier transform of the measured signal's modulus. Second,
	studies of in vitro and in vivo samples demonstrate correspondence
	between the orientational maxima of the diffusion spectrum and those
	of the fiber orientation density at each location. In specimens with
	complex muscular tissue, such as the tongue, diffusion spectrum images
	show characteristic local heterogeneities of fiber architectures,
	including angular dispersion and intersection. Cerebral diffusion
	spectra acquired in normal human subjects resolve known white matter
	tracts and tract intersections. Finally, the relation between the
	presented model-free imaging technique and other available diffusion
	MRI schemes is discussed. Magn Reson Med, 2005. Â© 2005 Wiley-Liss,

	image registration using an automated method (AIR 3.0) based on voxel
	intensity. METHOD: PET and MRI data from 22 normal subjects were
	registered to corresponding averaged PET or MRI brain atlases using
	several specific linear and nonlinear spatial transformation models
	with an automated algorithm. Validation was based on anatomically
	defined landmarks. RESULTS: Automated registration produced results
	that were superior to a manual nine parameter variant of the Talairach
	registration method. Increasing the degrees of freedom in the spatial
	transformation model improved the accuracy of automated intersubject
	registration. CONCLUSION: Linear or nonlinear automated intersubject
	registration based on voxel intensities is computationally practical
	and produces more accurate alignment of homologous landmarks than
	manual nine parameter Talairach registration. Nonlinear models provide
	better registration than linear models but are slower.},

  abstract = {Diffusion measurements in the human central nervous system are complex
	to characterize and a broad spectrum of methods have been proposed.
	In this study, a comprehensive diffusion encoding and analysis approach,
	hybrid diffusion imaging (HYDI), is described. The HYDI encoding
	scheme is composed of multiple concentric #shells# of constant diffusion
	weighting, which may be used to characterize the signal behavior
	with low, moderate and high diffusion weighting. HYDI facilitates
	the application of multiple data analyses strategies including diffusion
	tensor imaging (DTI), multi-exponential diffusion measurements, diffusion
	spectrum imaging (DSI) and q-ball imaging (QBI). These different
	analysis strategies may provide complementary information. DTI measures
	(mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy) may be estimated from
	either data in the inner shells or the entire HYDI data. Fast and
	slow diffusivities were estimated using a nonlinear least squares
	bi-exponential fit on geometric means of the HYDI shells. DSI measurements
	from the entire HYDI data yield empirical model-independent diffusion
	information and are well-suited for characterizing tissue regions
	with complex diffusion behavior. DSI measurements were characterized
	using the zero displacement probability and the mean-squared displacement.
	The outermost HYDI shell was analyzed using QBI analysis to estimate
	the orientation distribution function (ODF), which is useful for
	characterizing the directions of multiple fiber groups within a voxel.
	In this study, an HYDI encoding scheme with 102 diffusion-weighted
	measurements was obtained over most of the human cerebrum in under
	30Â min.},

  abstract = {In speech-production research, three-dimensional (3D) MRI of the

	upper airway has provided insights into vocal tract shaping and

	data for its modeling. Small movements of articulators can lead to

	large changes in the produced sound, therefore improving the

	resolution of these data sets, within the constraints of a sustained

	speech sound (6â12 s), is an important area for investigation. The

	purpose of the study is to provide a first application of compressed

	sensing (CS) to high-resolution 3D upper airway MRI

	using spatial finite difference as the sparsifying transform, and
	to

	experimentally determine the benefit of applying constraints on

	image phase. Estimates of image phase are incorporated into the

	CS reconstruction to improve the sparsity of the finite difference

	of the solution. In a retrospective subsampling experiment with no

	sound production, 5 and 4 were the highest acceleration factors

	that produced acceptable image quality when using a phase

	constraint and when not using a phase constraint, respectively.

	The prospective use of a 5undersampled acquisition and phaseconstrained

	CS reconstruction enabled 3D vocal tract MRI during

[Brun, A., Bjornemo, M., Kikinis, R., Westin, C.F., 2002. White matter tractography using sequential importance sampling. In: Proceedings of the ISMRM Annual Meeting, p. 1131] and Bjornemo et al. [Bjornemo, M., Brun, A., Kikinis, R., Westin, C.F., 2002. Regularized stochastic white matter tractography using diffusion tensor MRI, In: Proc. MICCAI, pp. 435-442]. However, these previous attempts have not utilised the full power of the technique, and as a result the fiber paths were tracked in a goal directed way. In this paper, we provide an advanced technique by presenting a fast and novel probabilistic method for white matter fiber tracking in diffusion weighted MRI (DWI), which takes advantage of the weighting and resampling mechanism of particle filtering. We formulate fiber tracking using a non-linear state space model which captures both smoothness regularity of the fibers and the uncertainties in the local fiber orientations due to noise and partial volume effects. Global fiber tracking is then posed as a problem of particle filtering. To model the posterior distribution, we classify voxels of the white matter as either prolate or oblate tensors. We then construct the orientation distributions for prolate and oblate tensors separately. Finally, the importance density function for particle filtering is modeled using the von Mises-Fisher distribution on a unit sphere. Fast and efficient sampling is achieved using Ulrich-WoodÜs simulation algorithm. Given a seed point, the method is able to rapidly locate the globally optimal fiber and also provides a probability map for potential connections. The proposed method is validated and compared to alternative methods both on synthetic data and real-world brain MRI datasets.}, number={1}, journal={Medical image analysis}, publisher={Elsevier B.V.}, author={Zhang, Fan and Hancock, Edwin R and Goodlett, Casey and Gerig, Guido}, year={2009}, pages={5--18}}

    abstract = {<p>Tractography based on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data is a method for identifying the major white matter fascicles (tracts) in the living human brain. The health of these tracts is an important factor underlying many cognitive and neurological disorders. <italic>In vivo</italic>, tissue properties may vary systematically along each tract for several reasons: different populations of axons enter and exit the tract, and disease can strike at local positions within the tract. Hence quantifying and understanding diffusion measures along each fiber tract (Tract Profile) may reveal new insights into white matter development, function, and disease that are not obvious from mean measures of that tract. We demonstrate several novel findings related to Tract Profiles in the brains of typically developing children and children at risk for white matter injury secondary to preterm birth. First, fractional anisotropy (FA) values vary substantially within a tract but the Tract FA Profile is consistent across subjects. Thus, Tract Profiles contain far more information than mean diffusion measures. Second, developmental changes in FA occur at specific positions within the Tract Profile, rather than along the entire tract. Third, Tract Profiles can be used to compare white matter properties of individual patients to standardized Tract Profiles of a healthy population to elucidate unique features of that patient's clinical condition. Fourth, Tract Profiles can be used to evaluate the association between white matter properties and behavioral outcomes. Specifically, in the preterm group reading ability is positively correlated with FA measured at specific locations on the left arcuate and left superior longitudinal fasciculus and the magnitude of the correlation varies significantly along the Tract Profiles. We introduce open source software for automated fiber-tract quantification (AFQ) that measures Tract Profiles of MRI parameters for 18 white matter tracts. With further validation, AFQ Tract Profiles have potential for informing clinical management and decision-making.</p>},

@article{Koay2006,
abstract = {A unifying theoretical and algorithmic framework for diffusion tensor estimation is presented. Theoretical connections among the least squares (LS) methods, (linear least squares (LLS), weighted linear least squares (WLLS), nonlinear least squares (NLS) and their constrained counterparts), are established through their respective objective functions, and higher order derivatives of these objective functions, i.e., Hessian matrices. These theoretical connections provide new insights in designing efficient algorithms for NLS and constrained NLS (CNLS) estimation. Here, we propose novel algorithms of full Newton-type for the NLS and CNLS estimations, which are evaluated with Monte Carlo simulations and compared with the commonly used Levenberg-Marquardt method. The proposed methods have a lower percent of relative error in estimating the trace and lower reduced chi2 value than those of the Levenberg-Marquardt method. These results also demonstrate that the accuracy of an estimate, particularly in a nonlinear estimation problem, is greatly affected by the Hessian matrix. In other words, the accuracy of a nonlinear estimation is algorithm-dependent. Further, this study shows that the noise variance in diffusion weighted signals is orientation dependent when signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low (<or=5). A new experimental design is, therefore, proposed to properly account for the directional dependence in diffusion weighted signal variance.},

abstract = {Signal variability in diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) is influenced by both thermal noise and spatially and temporally varying artifacts such as subject motion and cardiac pulsation. In this paper, the effects of DWI artifacts on estimated tensor values, such as trace and fractional anisotropy, are analyzed using Monte Carlo simulations. A novel approach for robust diffusion tensor estimation, called RESTORE (for robust estimation of tensors by outlier rejection), is proposed. This method uses iteratively reweighted least-squares regression to identify potential outliers and subsequently exclude them. Results from both simulated and clinical diffusion data sets indicate that the RESTORE method improves tensor estimation compared to the commonly used linear and nonlinear least-squares tensor fitting methods and a recently proposed method based on the Geman-McClure M-estimator. The RESTORE method could potentially remove the need for cardiac gating in DWI acquisitions and should be applicable to other MR imaging techniques that use univariate or multivariate regression to fit MRI data to a model.},

abstract = {Physiological noise artifacts, especially those originating from cardiac pulsation and subject motion, are common in clinical Diffusion tensor-MRI acquisitions. Previous works show that signal perturbations produced by artifacts can be severe and neglecting to account for their contribution can result in erroneous diffusion tensor values. The Robust Estimation of Tensors by Outlier Rejection (RESTORE) method has been shown to be an effective strategy for improving tensor estimation on a voxel-by-voxel basis in the presence of artifactual data points in diffusion-weighted images. In this article, we address potential instabilities that may arise when using RESTORE and propose practical constraints to improve its usability. Moreover, we introduce a method, called informed RESTORE designed to remove physiological noise artifacts in datasets acquired with low redundancy (less than 30-40 diffusion-weighted image volumes)--a condition in which the original RESTORE algorithm may converge to an incorrect solution. This new method is based on the notion that physiological noise is more likely to result in signal dropouts than signal increases. Results from both Monte Carlo simulation and clinical diffusion data indicate that informed RESTORE performs very well in removing physiological noise artifacts for low redundancy diffusion-weighted image datasets.},

@article{Frank2002,
abstract = {The methods of group theory are applied to the problem of characterizing the diffusion measured in high angular resolution MR experiments. This leads to a natural representation of the local diffusion in terms of spherical harmonics. In this representation, it is shown that isotropic diffusion, anisotropic diffusion from a single fiber, and anisotropic diffusion from multiple fiber directions fall into distinct and separable channels. This decomposition can be determined for any voxel without any prior information by a spherical harmonic transform, and for special cases the magnitude and orientation of the local diffusion may be determined. Moreover, non-diffusion-related asymmetries produced by experimental artifacts fall into channels distinct from the fiber channels, thereby allowing their separation and a subsequent reduction in noise from the reconstructed fibers. In the case of a single fiber, the method reduces identically to the standard diffusion tensor method. The method is applied to normal volunteer brain data collected with a stimulated echo spiral high angular resolution diffusion-weighted (HARD) acquisition.},

abstract = {The diffusion in voxels with multidirectional fibers can be quite complicated and not necessarily well characterized by the standard diffusion tensor model. High angular resolution diffusion-weighted acquisitions have recently been proposed as a method to investigate such voxels, but the reconstruction methods proposed require sophisticated estimation schemes. We present here a simple algorithm for the identification of diffusion anisotropy based upon the variance of the estimated apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) as a function of measurement direction. The rationale for this method is discussed, and results in normal human subjects acquired with a novel diffusion-weighted stimulated-echo spiral acquisition are presented which distinguish areas of anisotropy that are not apparent in the relative anisotropy maps derived from the standard diffusion tensor model.
